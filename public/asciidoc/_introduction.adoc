== Introduction

Neosemantics is a plugin that enables the *use of RDF in Neo4j*. https://www.w3.org/RDF/[RDF is a W3C standard model] for data interchange.
This effectively means that Neosemantics makes it possible to

* *Store RDF data in Neo4j* in a
lossless manner (imported RDF can subsequently be exported without losing a single triple in the process).
* On-demand *export property graph data* from Neo4j *as RDF*.

Other features in Neosemantics include *model mapping* and *inferencing* on Neo4j graphs.
